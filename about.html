        <h1>About page</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Project structure</h2>
            <p>
                My project is structured with a easy to reuse setup on every page, Index have a header with reusable
                navigation, main that contains articles and within these articles I structure my code with h2 and p
                tags.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the top part inside main I have an img contained within a div so I can have an easier time with the
                flow of the page from mobile to lager than 600px viewports. I also have a h1 on top of the site to show
                where the user is currently at. This structure is repeated on every page, even on the contact page where
                I have a form inside an article instead of text-elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The footer contains a wide iframe from google maps, underneath I have a logo and information about the
                address and who created this website.
            </p>
            <h2>How I did my design</h2>
            <p>
                I started in Figma and designed my website before I moved on to create it as html and css. The design
                and colors are inspired from sustainable goal 13. This means that I went with green colors and white
                color on the font.
            </p>
            <p>
                The visual hierarchy is nicely designed with the climate goal on the top of the site to show users the
                main concept and what the website is about. I have added the line: “let it inspire you” so the user will
                feel a little curious when entering the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content of the page is presented to the user bit by bit. In the articles it starts off with an
                heading followed by a paragraph. The paragraph is not too long and it gives the user time to breathe
                before moving on to the next one.
            </p>
            <p>
                The iframe on the website (map from google maps) is designed big enough to give the user ability to move
                it around freely. It's supposed to be big and usable for the user to be able to interact with it. I did
                not see a reason not to give the user a proper map to use instead of a small window.
            </p>
            <h2>Font</h2>
            <p>
                I have used the font-family Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. This is more of the common font and fallback
                font to use on the web and it felt natural to go with something common. I don't really use any special
                fonts when I do my work, it's usually Arial with Helvetica as a fallback.
            </p>
            <h2>Planning process, how do I work</h2>
            <p>
                I started out with a small wireframe on paper to draw everything out and come up with a quick process
                before I moved my sketch into Figma. Inside Figma I created the web side digitally, I created both
                desktop and mobile view.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I had created the figma prototype I quickly structured the html before moving on to css. The style
                I went with was to design it from mobile view so I could create a more responsive style from the start.
